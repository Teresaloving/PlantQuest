# PlantQuest - Project Description

**Short Description (120 characters):**
PlantQuest: FHEVM-powered DApp for encrypted plant-based lifestyle challenges with NFT rewards and leaderboards.

**Full Description:**
**PlantQuest** is a decentralized application (DApp) that enables users to participate in plant-based lifestyle challenges while maintaining complete privacy through fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) technology. Built on FHEVM, the platform allows users to log daily progress, track their journey, and earn NFT achievements—all while keeping sensitive data encrypted on-chain. With features including encrypted progress tracking, leaderboards, community engagement, and reward systems, PlantQuest demonstrates how blockchain technology can protect user privacy while fostering healthy habits. The application features a modern dark/cyberpunk-themed interface and leverages cutting-edge cryptographic techniques to ensure that challenge data remains confidential even when stored on public blockchains.
